Thought Process2

//Note** i should have the code rewritten to spit out various metrics in an array to understand the returns based on different risk parameters 
//so PM’s can see how they do in relation to: benchmark, RFR, nominal reaturn, and real money(taking into account changes in M2)
//also tax brackets

1. **Calculate the Real Risk-Free Rate**:
   - Start with the nominal risk-free rate.
   - Subtract the change in M2 money supply over the period divided by the initial M2 money supply.
   - This gives you the real risk-free rate.

2. **Calculate the Portfolio's Alpha Relative to the Benchmark**:
   - Take the portfolio's annualized return.
   - Subtract the sum of the benchmark return and the real risk-free rate calculated earlier.
   - This gives you the portfolio's alpha relative to the benchmark.

3. **Adjust the Portfolio's Alpha for Realized Drawdown**:
   - Take the portfolio's alpha relative to the benchmark.
   - Divide it by the ratio of the realized drawdown to the maximum allowed drawdown (the risk budget).
   - This gives you the adjusted portfolio alpha.

4. **Account for Monetary Debasement**:
   - Subtract the change in M2 money supply over the period divided by the initial M2 money supply from the adjusted portfolio alpha.
   - This adjustment penalizes the portfolio for holding cash and dollar denominated returns due to the long term effects of monetary debasement.

5. **Calculate the Benchmark’s Risk-Adjusted Alpha**:
   - Subtract the real risk-free rate from the benchmark return.
   - Divide this result by the benchmark's drawdown.
   - This gives you the benchmark's risk-adjusted alpha.

6. **Final Metric**:
   - Finally, take the portfolio's adjusted alpha (which accounts for monetary debasement).
   - Divide it by the benchmark's risk-adjusted alpha.
   - This final metric reflects how well the portfolio's risk-adjusted returns perform relative to the benchmark's risk-adjusted returns, considering all factors such as drawdown risk, monetary debasement, and market risk.

### Summary:

- Start with the portfolio's return.
- Adjust it for the real risk-free rate (based on M2).
- Adjust further for the realized drawdown as a fraction of the maximum allowed drawdown.
- Finally, adjust for monetary debasement using the change in M2.
- Compare this to the benchmark’s risk-adjusted return.

This metric provides a comprehensive view of the portfolio's performance, adjusting for the real economic factors and risks that the manager is concerned about.
